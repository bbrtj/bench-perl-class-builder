# What's this?

[In Perl 5.38, the class feature was integrated into the core](https://metacpan.org/release/RJBS/perl-5.38.0/view/pod/perldelta.pod), so I compared it with many class builders. 
The class feature is still in the experimental stage, so I think the results may change depending on future development. 
In the following execution environment, the class feature had the best memory efficiency, and the results of the constructor of an object and access to object fields are equivalent to those of objects blessed with array references.
